# odin-recipies
This is my first project of an open source coding cirriculum called The Odin Project.

Here, I intend to display my recently learned HTML basics that include:
-proper html structure (boilerplate),
-text formatting,
-creating links and embedding images.

I begin with high hopes in the success of this project. Though simple, I'm excited to be working toward my first project.
